/*
 * a) Using a byte variable, what is the largest factorial that can 
be calculated.  A factorial is simply 

n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 ... * (n-2) * (n-1) * n

For instance, 1! = 1,  2! = 2,  3! = 6,  4! = 24,  5! = 120 etc....

b)  What would be the largest factorial using short, int, long, float, 
double, etc...  Use all the primitive data types that you are familiar 
with signed as well as unsigned.

Note:  I want you to investigate this and the program you 
turn in should just print "cout" the final results.  You don't know 
how to capture errors yet so run each till it overflows then back off by 1.
Don't need the program that tests for this.
