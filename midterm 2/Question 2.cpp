/*
 * Develop an application using an array of structures that will 
determine the gross pay for any number of employees input. The company pays 
"straight-time" for the first 30 hours worked, double time for 
all hours worked in excess of 30 hours but less than 50 hours, 
and triple time for any hours worked over 50 hours.

The program should be able to loop and input the employee's name, 
hours worked, and the rate of pay.  Once this has been done then output
this information including the gross pay in the form of a paycheck.
The process starts all over 
again until you input an invalid rate of pay or hours worked.  This
means a negative rate of pay or negative number of hours worked is
not acceptable.

Prinout like a company Paycheck with format:
     Company
     Address
     Name:	Amount: numerical
     Amount: English
          Signature:
