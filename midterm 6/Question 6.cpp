/*
 * a)  Convert the following 2 numbers to binary, octal and hex.
	2.875, 0.1796875
        When done, convert the following to a float representation
        by the definition in class. In other words, I want an 8 digit hex 
	    number representation using the 4 byte float specification
        defined in class.  
   b)  Do the same for a) given they are negative values.
   c)  Convert the float representations of the following into 
	the decimal number given the definition in class.
	59999901, 59999902, A66667FE

Note:  This doesn't require a program, however, I want you to write a 
simple function that outputs the answers you did by hand with "cout".
